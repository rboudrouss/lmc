Almost eleven years after Boudon’s passing, __Engaging with Boudon__ proposes a new systematic assessment of Boudon’s scientific legacy for today social theory and empirical research as well as for teaching sociology.

__du Jeudi 27 au Samedi 29 Juin__  
Maison de la Recherche, amphithéâtre Molinié.  
[Inscription Obligatoire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScX9OgOpJYJ8iGHouUxwCw31PsosgO2hRJKJyZpcQNh0pAbJw/viewform)

The symposium brings together scholars from different generations who accepted to engage with Boudon’s specific pieces of work in order to assess how the main ideas developed in the chosen pieces are currently at work in contemporary sociological research.  
The selected pieces to be commented on cover all main topics and research areas in which Raymond Boudon’s landmarks can be reasonably found, including the methodology of generative models and numerical simulations, the sociology of social stratification, the sociology of social change, the sociology of values and beliefs, the theory of action and of rationality, as well as the history of sociological thought.
